            our most popular destinations are Google Analytics, Mixpanel, KISSmetrics, Customer.io, Intercom, and
            KeenIO.

            All of these tools run on the same data: who are your customers and what are they doing? But each tool
            requires that you send that data in a slightly different format, which means that youâ€™d have to write code
            to track all of this information, again and again, for each tool, on each page of your app or website.
