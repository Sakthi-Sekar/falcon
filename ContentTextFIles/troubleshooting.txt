            From your Segment UI’s Destinations page click on “Add Destination”.
             Search for “Evergage” within the Destinations Catalog and confirm the Source you’d like to connect
                to.
           Enter your Evergage Account Key (this is the subdomain you use to login to Evergage with; if your
                account is “testaccount.evergage.com”, then use “testaccount”);
             Finally, enter the name of the Evergage Dataset you want data to flow to (by default this is
                “engage”);
