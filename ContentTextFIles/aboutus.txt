Tell a Great Story – Telling a great story with words, video production, or even a timeline helps evoke an emotional response in the customer, which is proven to increase their intent to buy.

Build Trust Through Photos – Showing photos of the founders or team members helps convey that the company is full of real, relatable people that you can trust with your business.

Clear Value Proposition – Providing a simple, clear value proposition is the easiest way to get a user’s attention.

Establish Credibility – To appear credible in the eyes of your customers, you can show off reviews, testimonials, or if you are a web design site, showcase your skills on the page itself.

Clear Call-to-Action – Always tell the customer what to do next. This can be with an actual button, or by providing your contact information so they know how to get in touch.
