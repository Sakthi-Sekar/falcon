            how to translate it so we can send it along to any destination. You enable destinations from the catalog in
            the Segment App, and user data immediately starts flowing into those tools. No extra code required!

            We support many categories of destinations, from advertising to marketing, email to customer support, CRM to
            user testing, and even data warehouses. You can view a complete list of our destinations or check out our
            destination page for a searchable list broken down by category.
