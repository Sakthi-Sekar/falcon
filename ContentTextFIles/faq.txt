Most companies have an FAQ — or Frequently Asked Questions — page on their website. Some may even have a few pages depending on the products or services they provide. FAQ pages include a series of questions that are commonly asked by customers. They cover a variety of topics including product or service usage, business hours, prices, and more.
FAQ pages are important because they save time for both customers and employees. Customers don't have to go through the trouble of contacting a customer support team to get answers to simple questions. Employees don't have to waste time offering support for questions that are frequently asked and could be easily answered with a standardized response.
